# Assumptions and Constraints

While architecting the solution for MonitorMe, there were some underlying assumptions that were considered.

## Assumptions

1. Sensor or Device Signal that is transmitted from the medical instrument is already a data object recognizable and readable by the server system.
2. Fallbacks and failsafes for medical devices next to a patient bed are not accounted for in this architecture.
3. Patient to bed mapping is manually done by a hospital admin. The same is true for doctors or nurse mapping to a nursing station.


## Constraints

1. Near real time processing of signals with minimal latency generated by devices next to a patient bed.
2. Data security and confidentiality has to be maintained throughtout the entire flow.
3. All systems pertaining to MoniterMe have to be on premise that can successfully integrate with the cloud products MyMedicalData and MonitorThem.
4. Past record of medical data has to be persisted for a duration of 24 hours.
5. Proactive recognition of errors or faults and timely alerting to the downstream systems ( Nursing station, monitorMe frontend and the mobile app)
